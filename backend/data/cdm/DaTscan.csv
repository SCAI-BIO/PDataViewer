DaTscan - Radiopharmaceutical Compound,NCIT:C1446,An agent that contains a radioactive isotope and is used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.,"radiopharmaceutical, Radiochemical, Radiopharmaceutical Compound, Radiopharmaceutical, Radiopharmaceuticals, Radioactive Pharmaceutical, radioactive drug",DATSCAN_LIGAND,,,,,,,C0677236,,,,,,,1
DaTscan - Left Caudate,,"DaTscan - Left Caudate refers to the striatal binding ratio (SBR) measured in the left caudate region of interest during a dopamine transporter (DaT) scan. The SBR is calculated by comparing the radiotracer uptake in the left caudate to that in the occipital lobe, which serves as a reference region with minimal DaT expression.",,DATSCAN_CAUDATE_L,,question304_304,,,,,,,,,,,,1
DaTscan - Right Caudate,,"DaTscan - Right Caudate refers to the striatal binding ratio (SBR) measured in the right caudate region of interest during a dopamine transporter (DaT) scan. The SBR is calculated by comparing radiotracer uptake in the right caudate to that in the occipital lobe, which serves as a reference region with minimal dopamine transporter activity.",,DATSCAN_CAUDATE_R,,question304_304,,,,,,,,,,,,1
DaTscan - Left Putamen,,"DaTscan - Left Putamen refers to the striatal binding ratio (SBR) measured in the left putamen region of interest during a dopamine transporter (DaT) scan. The SBR is calculated by comparing radiotracer uptake in the left putamen to that in the occipital lobe, which serves as a reference region with minimal dopamine transporter activity.",,DATSCAN_PUTAMEN_L,,question304_304,,,,,,,,,,,,1
DaTscan - Left Anterior Putamen,,"DaTscan - Left Anteroir Putamen refers to the striatal binding ratio (SBR) measured in the left anterior putamen region of interest during a dopamine transporter (DaT) scan.
