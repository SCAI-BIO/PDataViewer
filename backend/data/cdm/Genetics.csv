G2019S - Patient,,"G2019S is a pathogenic variant in the LRRK2 gene (PARK8) associated with Parkinson's disease. This variant leads to increased autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of a generic substrate, as well as heightened phosphorylation of PRDX3, which dysregulates mitochondrial function and promotes oxidative damage. It also increases phosphorylation of APP at T-743, contributing to neurotoxicity in dopaminergic neurons. The variant shows increased kinase activity in phosphorylating RAB10, but does not inhibit interaction with RAB29. Additionally, it causes a progressive reduction in neurite length and branching, along with the formation of spheroid-like inclusions in neuronal processes and membranous structures. It is also linked to lysosomal swelling and impaired retrograde transport of selective cargo between lysosomes and the Golgi apparatus. The variant induces apoptotic cell death mechanisms, but does not disrupt interaction with SEC16A. It is cataloged in several genetic databases, including UniProt (VAR_024958), ClinGen (CA339926), ClinVar (RCV000002017, RCV000325492, RCV000622347, RCV001195216, RCV001836691), 1000 Genomes, ESP, ExAC, TOPMed, dbSNP, and gnomAD (rs34637584).",,,,,g2019ss,,,,C5412392,,,,,,,1
