Black teas also contain other phytochemicals such as flavonoid and flavonoid-related compounds with strong antioxidant effects. They also attenuate atherosclerotic inflammation, reduce thrombosis, promote normal endothelial function, and block expression of cellular adhesion molecules.

Green tea contains polyphenols that are believed to be responsible for its chemopreventive effect. The polyphenol fraction contains mainly Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and other catechins, such as epicatechin (EC), gallocatechin gallate (GCG), epigallocatechin (EGC), and epicatechin gallate (ECG). Green tea polyphenols act as antioxidants and free radical scavengers and may affect enzymes involved in cellular replication and tumor angiogenesis by modulating angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).","Green Tea, GREEN TEA LEAF",,,,cgtea,,,4259074,,,,"100420-0.0, 100420-1.0, 100420-2.0, 100420-3.0, 100420-4.0",,,1
