<h1>Mappings</h1>
<p>
  <br />
  The Mappings helps you to identify semantic equivalent of the feature(s) of
  your interest in another cohort. <br />
  <br />

  Adjust the "Maximum Number of Features" slider to adjust the maximum number of
  features to be displayed in a single chord diagram <br />
  <br />

  You can hover over the feature of your interest to highlight its semantic
  equivalent(s). <br />
  <br />

  Some of the modalities are too big to showcase in a singular chord diagram,
  especially with a low "Maximum Number of Features" setting. You might need to
  scroll down to be able to see all the diagrams. <br />
  <br />

  Unfortunately, due to data limitation, there might be no mappings to showcase
  for some modalities. Please keep in touch, as we are trying to collect more
  data each day! <br />
  <br />

  Please select a modality to continue.
